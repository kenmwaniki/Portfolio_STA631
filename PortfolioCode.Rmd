## Part 1: Multiple Linear Regression with categorical and numeric predictors.

```{r}
data(diamonds)  # This step is optional; `diamonds` is already loaded with ggplot2

### Changing Ordinal Categorical varables to Factors
```{r}
# Convert ordinal variables to factors
diamonds$cut <- factor(diamonds$cut, 
                       levels = c("Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Premium", "Ideal"), 
                       ordered = TRUE)

diamonds$color <- factor(diamonds$color, 
                         levels = c("J", "I", "H", "G", "F", "E", "D"), 
                         ordered = TRUE)

diamonds$clarity <- factor(diamonds$clarity, 
                           levels = c("I1", "SI2", "SI1", "VS2", "VS1", "VVS2", "VVS1", "IF"), 
                           ordered = TRUE)

```

## The Categorical variables are cut,color and clarity.
```{r,message=FALSE}
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)
diamonds %>%
  dplyr::select(carat,depth, table, price,x,y,z) %>%
  ggpairs()
```



```{r}

# Scatter plot: carat vs price
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat, color = color)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +

```

## To determine the best Quantitative variable to use, multicollinearity  has to be put into consideration.
## It is also important to use a variable that is most Correlated with Carat.


```{r}
library(car)
model <- lm(carat ~ depth + table + price + x + y + z, data = diamonds)
vif(model)
```
### Price has a low VIF and is higly correlated with Carat, so it will be used as the numeric variable.
## To determine the categorical model iam going to use, i will do an Anova test.
```{r}
# Add cut, color, clarity one at a time
model_base <- lm(carat ~ 1, data = diamonds)  # Base model (intercept only)
model_cut <- lm(carat ~ cut, data = diamonds)
model_color <- lm(carat ~ color, data = diamonds)
model_clarity <- lm(carat ~ clarity, data = diamonds)

anova(model_base, model_cut, model_color, model_clarity)
```
### Model1 which is the null model has an RSS of 12119 
### Model2 reduces RSS from 12119 (Model 1) to 11690.The reduction in RSS 429.74 is significant, with an F-statistic of 554.09 and a p-value < 2.2e-16.This indicates that cut significantly contributes to predicting carat.
### Model3  reduces the  RSS by  704.01 is highly significant, with an F-statistic of 1815.47 and a p-value < 2.2e-16.color is a stronger predictor than cut.
### Model4 reduces the  RSS by 528.60 is also highly significant, with an F-statistic of 2726.26 and a p-value < 2.2e-16.
### clarity is the strongest predictor of carat as it has the highest F Statistic among the three categorical variables and will be used for prediction.
```{r}
levels(diamonds$clarity)
summary(diamonds$clarity)
```
## The most common is SI1,while I1 is the least included.
```{r}

# Create the high_clarity variable
diamonds <- diamonds %>%
  mutate(high_clarity = ifelse(clarity %in% c("VVS1", "VVS2", "IF"), "Yes", "No"))

diamonds
```
## Fitting the Multiple regression.
```{r,message=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(parsnip)
library(broom)
set.seed(195)  # For reproducibility

train_index <- createDataPartition(diamonds$carat, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_data <- diamonds[train_index, ]
test_data <- diamonds[-train_index, ]

lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")
d_weight <- lm_spec %>%
  fit(carat ~ price*high_clarity, data = train_data)
tidy(d_weight)
```
### Intercept Estimate is 0.3915.This is the predicted value of the response variable when all predictors (price and high_clarityYes) are at 0. P-value: 0.0000000 meaning The intercept is statistically significant 
### price is Estimated: 0.0.0001119276.For every unit increase in price, the response variable (carat) increases by approximately 0.000109, assuming high_clarityYes remains constant.price is a highly significant predictor of the response variable
### Diamonds with high clarity have a response value (carat) that is approximately 0.0945481421	lower compared to diamonds with high_clarity = "No", holding price constant.This predictor is extremely significant since it has a very low p_value.
### This interaction term suggests that the effect of price on the response variable changes when high_clarity is Yes. For each unit increase in price, the response decreases by  0.0000263839	 when high_clarity = Yes.

## Model FIT
```{r}
# Summary of the linear model
summary(d_weight$fit)
```
### The model has an R2 of 87.9% meaning it is able to explain 85% of the variance in Carat.
```{r}
# Residual diagnostics
plot(d_weight$fit)

```
### REsidual Vs laverage:The residuals appear randomly scattered around 0. This suggests the model has captured most patterns in the data.Points to the far right of the x-axis have high leverage, meaning they are far from the average of the predictors.
### QQ Plot : linearity assumption has been mostly met.
### Residual Vs Fitted: The normality assumption is met.
```{r}
test_data$predicted_carat <- predict(d_weight, new_data = test_data)$.pred
# Calculate RMSE and MAE
rmse <- sqrt(mean((test_data$carat - test_data$predicted_carat)^2))
mae <- mean(abs(test_data$carat - test_data$predicted_carat))
cat("RMSE:", rmse, "\n")
cat("MAE:", mae, "\n")
```
### RMSE: On average, the predicted carat deviates from the actual value by approximately 0.167 carats. A lower RMSE indicates better model fit.
### MAE: On average, the modelâ€™s predictions are off by about 0.121 carats.
### RMSE is slightly higher than MAE because RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily due to squaring residuals.The relatively close values suggest the model is not being significantly affected by large outliers in the data, which is good.


## Part 2 : multinomial regression, LDA and Lasso Regression for variable selection.

## Importing the 2016 datasetset 

## Section 1

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(ISLR2)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidymodels)

# Read the Excel file
pfi_curated_2016 <- read_excel("pfi-data.xlsx", sheet = "curated 2016")

# Reorder columns alphabetically
pfi_curated_2016 <- pfi_curated_2016 %>%
  dplyr::select(sort(names(.)))  # Corrected syntax

# View result
#pfi_curated_2016
```

## Importing the 2019 datasetset 

## The dataset is also cleaned to remove all negative values since they represented unanswered questions in the questionaire.

```{r}
pfi_curated_2019 <- read_excel("pfi-data.xlsx", sheet = "curated 2019")

pfi_curated_2019 <- pfi_curated_2019 %>%
  filter(if_all(everything(), ~ . >= 0))
#head(pfi_curated_2019)
```

## Converting all ordinal variables into factors

```{r}
pfi_curated_2019 <- pfi_curated_2019 %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), as.factor))  # Remove the parentheses after is.numeric

categorical_vars <- names(pfi_curated_2016)[sapply(pfi_curated_2019, is.factor)]

print(categorical_vars)

head(pfi_curated_2019)
```


```{r}
#pfi_curated <- bind_rows(pfi_curated_2016 %>% mutate(Year = 2016),
                      # pfi_curated_2019 %>% mutate(Year = 2019))
# Check structure
```

## After going through the dataset, the following variables were indentified to be the most useful to predict the response variable,SEGRADES

```{r}
pfi_curated_2019 <- pfi_curated_2019 %>%
  dplyr::select(SEFUTUREX, SEGRADEQ, SEGRADES, EDCPUB, FHWKHRS, DSBLTY, FSCOUNSLR, NUMSIBSX, TTLHHINC, FOSPORT,SEENJOY,SEABSNT, PARGRADEX, SCHLHRSWK, FCSCHOOL, FHHOME,
         CSEX, EINTNET, HDHEALTH, FSMTNG,SCCHOICE,SPUBCHOIX,FSATCNFN,FSVOL,FSPTMTNG,FSFREQ,FHHELP,FHCHECKX)

pfi_curated_2019 <- pfi_curated_2019 %>%
  mutate(across(c(SEFUTUREX, SEGRADEQ, SEGRADES, EDCPUB, FHWKHRS, DSBLTY, FSCOUNSLR, NUMSIBSX, TTLHHINC, FOSPORT,SEENJOY,SEABSNT, PARGRADEX, SCHLHRSWK, FCSCHOOL, FHHOME,
         CSEX, EINTNET, HDHEALTH, FSMTNG,SCCHOICE,SPUBCHOIX,FSATCNFN,FSVOL,FSPTMTNG,FSFREQ,FHHELP,FHCHECKX), as.factor))
```

## Splitting the dataset into trainingset and testset.

## A random seed is choosen for consistency in the split.

```{r}
ggplot(pfi_curated_2019, aes(x = factor(SEGRADES))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Self-Reported Grades (SEGRADES)", x = "Grade", y = "Count")

  labs(title = "Self-Perception vs Actual Grades",
       x = "Self-Perceived Grade (SEGRADEQ)", y = "Count") +

## Section 2

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(nnet)  # package for multinomial regression

# Split the data (80% train, 20% test)
data_split <- initial_split(pfi_curated_2019, prop = 0.8, strata = SEGRADES)
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

# Ensure outcome is a factor
pfi_curated_2019$SEGRADES <- as.factor(pfi_curated_2019$SEGRADES)

# Fit full model
full_model <- multinom(SEGRADES ~ ., data = pfi_curated_2019, trace = FALSE)

# Stepwise model selection (quietly)

print(best_predictors)
```


```{r}
table(train_data$SEGRADES)

```

## Setting up cross_validation for so as to retrain the model with the selected 9 preditors.

## Since the classes within SEGRADES have diffrent values , a weight metric is used in the training of the model.

```{r}
# Create cross-validation folds (5-fold cross-validation)
cv_folds <- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 5, strata = SEGRADES)

# Define multinomial logistic regression model with class weights
class_weights <- table(train_data$SEGRADES)
class_weights
class_weights <- max(class_weights) / class_weights  # Normalize
class_weights
```


```{r}
multinom_model <- multinom_reg(mode = "classification", penalty = 0.1) %>%
  set_engine("nnet", MaxNWts = 10000, class.weights = class_weights)
```

## Training the reduced model

```{r}
# Define the preprocessing recipe
#multinom_recipe <- recipe(SEGRADES ~SEFUTUREX+SEGRADEQ+FHWKHRS+TTLHHINC+SEENJOY+SEABSNT+EINTNET+FHHELP , data = train_data) %>%
multinom_recipe <- recipe(SEGRADES ~SEFUTUREX+SEGRADEQ+FSCOUNSLR+SEABSNT+FHHOME+CSEX+EINTNET+SCCHOICE+FSATCNFN+FSVOL+FHHELP+FHCHECKX , data = train_data) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>% 
  update_role(SEGRADES, new_role = "outcome") %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors(), -all_outcomes())  # Convert categorical variables to dummy variables

# Create workflow
multinom_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(multinom_model) %>%
  add_recipe(multinom_recipe)
```

## Fitting the model and taking the average accuracy of the folds.


```{r}
library(yardstick)
library(tidymodels)  # Ensures all tidymodels components are loaded

# Make sure SEGRADES is factor before defining cv_folds
train_data <- train_data %>%
  mutate(SEGRADES = as.factor(SEGRADES))

# Define cross-validation with strata explicitly
set.seed(123)  # reproducibility
cv_folds <- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 5, strata = SEGRADES)

# Fit resamples and calculate accuracy and kappa
cv_results <- multinom_workflow %>%
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = cv_folds,
    metrics = metric_set(yardstick::accuracy, yardstick::kap,yardstick::roc_auc)
  )

# View cross-validation results
cv_results %>%
  collect_metrics()

```

## The  model correctly predicted the grade category about 64.5% of the time.

## The average ability of your model to separate classes is 82.6%, which is good.

## The model is performing much better than chance in its classification since its  KAP is approximately 40.3%, clearly indicating a moderate level of agreement between predicted grades and actual grades.

## These results suggest the model performs well at classifying student academic outcomes based on parent involvement and school-related factors.

```{r,message=FALSE}
# Train the final model on full training data
final_model <- multinom_workflow %>%
  fit(data = train_data)
```


```{r}
# Extract the underlying model from the fitted workflow
final_fit_model <- extract_fit_engine(final_model)
# View the coefficients
#coef(final_fit_model)
```

## Coefficients of the predictors variables.

```{r}
library(tibble)

as_tibble(coef(final_fit_model), rownames = "GradeCategory")
```
```{r}
#final_fit_model$coefnames  # shows variable names
#final_fit_model$AIC        # model AIC

```

## Section 3

## Preparing the testdataset for prediction.

```{r}
test_data <- test_data %>%
  filter(SEGRADES != -1) %>%
  mutate(SEGRADES = factor(SEGRADES, levels = c(1, 2, 3,4,5)))

```



```{r}
# Make predictions on test data
test_predictions <- final_model %>%
  predict(new_data = test_data, type = "class")


# Evaluate accuracy on test data
test_results <- test_data %>%
  bind_cols(test_predictions)

test_metrics <- test_results %>%
  metrics(truth = SEGRADES, estimate = .pred_class)

# Print final accuracy
test_metrics

```

## The model correctly predicted the grade category 65.7% of the time on the test set. That's slightly better than cross-validation accuracy (67.9%).

## Cohenâ€™s Kappa measures how much better your model is than random guessing, adjusted for chance. A Kappa of 47% shows moderate agreement.

```{r}
test_results <- test_data %>%
  bind_cols(test_predictions)
test_results
```

## A confusion matrix of prediction and groundtruth

```{r}
# Create confusion matrix
conf_mat(test_results, truth = SEGRADES, estimate = .pred_class)
```

## A heatmap of the confusion Matrix

```{r}
test_results %>%
  conf_mat(truth = SEGRADES, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap") +  # Ensure heatmap type
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "grey", high = "blue") +  # Adjust color scale
  ggtitle("Confusion Matrix Heatmap") +  # Add a title
  theme_minimal()  # Apply a minimal theme

## Converts your model's coefficients into a clear, readable table showing each predictor variable's influence.

## This makes interpreting your model's results straightforward.

## The Lasso regression picks out 9 Variables as the strongest predictors of SEGRADES.

selected_original_vars <- selected_original_vars[selected_original_vars != ""]
print(selected_original_vars)
```


## From theLASSO model, the variables selectedâ€‚reflect a rich array of student behaviors, family conditions, and parent interactions that all affect academic success. One item, for example, SEENJOY, which measures studentsâ€™ enjoymentâ€‚of school, is a strong predictor of both of these important traitsâ€”engagement and motivationâ€”that are closely related to achievement. By the same token, SEGRADEQ, or the student's self-perceived grade, is a measure of academic self-confidence and canâ€‚affect both effort and results. EINTNET is aâ€‚measure of access to resources as well, and could signify home internet availability â€” a critical resource for research, assignments, and learning remotely.

## FHWKHRS, this is the number of hoursâ€‚a student devotes to homework each week; this stands for study habits The better the discipline andâ€‚diligence in studies, this variable directly correlates with it. The great theme is parental involvement reflected through several varying variables: FSVOL (parent volunteer activity); FSCOUNSLR (parent-school counselor interactions); FSFREQ(frequency of parent-school communication); and FHHELP (parentalâ€‚help with homework). All these are activities that signal how involved parents are inâ€‚their childâ€™s education, and research shows consistently that children whose parents are invested succeed in school.

## You also have socioeconomic and contextual factors, like SPUBCHOIX, which indicates whether the parents actively chose the studentâ€™s public schoolâ€”often indicative of higher levels of awareness and engagementâ€‚in educational decision-making. HDHEALTH: The health status of household members can affect a studentâ€™sâ€‚ability to focus or to attend class regularly. Ultimately, economic considerations are encapsulated in the total householdâ€‚income (TTLHHINC), which may capture the availability of learning materials, tutoring, and a stable learning environment. The combined effect of these variables provides a more holistic perspective on the educational influences acting on an individual student,â€‚lending further credence to the modelâ€™s "in-school" versus "at-home" consideration.

## Both Lasso regression and AIC in the multinormial regression picked Common Variables Selected by Both Models:
## SEGRADEQ (Self-perceived grades)
## EINTNET (Internet access at home)
## FSVOL (Parental volunteer activity)
## FSCOUNSLR (Parent-school counselor interaction)
## FHHELP (Parental help with homework)

## The reason why there was a difference in the predictors of the two models is because Stepwise regression adds or removes predictors one at a time based on how much they improve the model's AIC (Akaike Information Criterion).AIC tries to balance model fit with complexityâ€”favoring models that explain the data well without being overly complicated. Itâ€™s a greedy algorithm, meaning it may settle for a "good enough" model rather than the absolute best one. while LASSO penalizes the size of coefficients, pushing some of them exactly to zero. Itâ€™s focused on simplifying the model by keeping only the most influential variables and discarding the rest. It handles multicollinearity wellâ€”if two variables are correlated, LASSO will usually pick only one.Itâ€™s particularly good at feature selection, often creating sparser models with fewer but stronger predictors.
