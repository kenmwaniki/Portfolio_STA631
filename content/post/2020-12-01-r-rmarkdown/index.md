Participation was more than just doing the assignments. I answered questions in the middle of the class when I was confused, I helped classmates on clean modeling syntax, 
and I engaged with data on model selection when we discussed the correct model by answering in class. I contributed ideas and assisted in debugging code during pair coding 
or group work. This created a sense of community, which kept learning collaborative. I also examined my growth as a learner, including my goal setting and tracking of 
progress through early course reflections. These efforts kept me engaged and added to the collective learning experience.
