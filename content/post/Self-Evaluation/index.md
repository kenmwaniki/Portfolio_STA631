Dear Current Me,

At the beginning of this semester, I endeavoured to improve myself as a statistical modeler, and communicator. My goal is to get comfortable with R and the tidymodels framework but, actually more importantly, to learn about why we use certain models, how to validate them correctly and how to explain them clear to another person. I went in feeling somewhat on shaky ground, particularly after I read the syllabus and saw the list of models we’d be working through — some of which I had never attempted. But I told myself I would remain curious, work hard and lean into the challenge.

Now I realize, reflecting on my past how far I have come. I now model things much better than I used to. Now I can confidently use logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression and polynomial regression; and compare between models using RMSE, ROC AUC, accuracy. More importantly, I understand the reasoning behind these tools—when to use them, what assumptions need checking, and how to interpret their output. I’ve also learned how to organize a tidy modeling workflow using recipes, workflows and resampling techniques such as vfold_cv. And this structured approach has helped me keep it organized and not made much error while training the models.

One of the things that surprised me was how much I actually loved model selection. What used to seem like Equilibrium—random things that were confusing to me now looks like a creative niche platform process. Homework 5 and 6 compared different models, polynomial degrees, stepwise regression, ridge and lasso. These assignments schooled me into how model building is part exploration, part logic, and part storytelling. It’s not about finding the “perfect” model — it’s about making judicious decisions, assessing trade-offs, and being open about limitations. That change in perspective made me more comfortable with ambiguity and more confident in how I was approaching things.”

But of course, it was not always easy. One challenge I faced was debugging my code in R, especially since I had long workflows. One small typo in a recipe() or a misnamed column could break everything. At the beginning of the semester, I would give up on myself. But gradually I became equipped to slow down, read error messages carefully, and segment the code to see what was going awry. I also relied on classmates and asked questions on Slack, which helped in figuring out problems more quickly. These experiences of debugging strengthened me and taught me resourcefulness, and now I’m not afraid to try things!

A subsequent hurdle was to express my results in everyday language. I used to follow this pattern of technical jargon and formulas to make my explanations sound sophisticated. But by way of examples like Homework 3 and the GLM Project, I learned how to sink odds ratios, coefficients, and performance metrics into everyday lingo. I came to the conclusion that a good model is only good if people understand what it is telling us. Now I pay more attention to summaries written to address real questions — things like “Which group is more likely to do X?” or “To what degree does this factor affect the outcome?” —rather than merely recounting numbers.

One thing I’m still struggling with is interpretation of complex models like those with lots of predictors or interactions. I often have a hard time seeking out ways to disentangle overlapping effects and explain what’s driving the predictions. I am going to keep practicing through side projects and new datasets. I also want to improve my visual storytelling — how I can use plots and dashboards to back up my interpretations. I am particularly looking forward to learning Shiny so that I can make interactive reports.

Forward-looking, I’m eager to implement what I learned. This class provided me with a strong foundation in not only modeling but thinking rigorously about data. Now, I tackle issues with a greater sense of uncertainty, validation and audience. I also know how to continue learning — I’ve developed good habits asking questions, reading documentation, and experimenting. I intend to cover topics such as time series, clustering, and deep learning and I want to create a portfolio that highlights technical skills and the ability to communicate to others.

I think I deserve an A in this class because I’m above and beyond the minimum. I consistently showed up, completed every assignment with thoughtfulness and challenged myself to grow. I also learned from my classmates when I helped them debug their code, asked questions in class, or reflected on my progress through written reflections. Most importantly, I grew — not only in skill, though there was that too, but in confidence, curiosity and persistence.

Sincerely,

Ken Mwaniki Muchira
