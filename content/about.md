Welcome to my final portfolio for STA 631.

This portfolio showcases my learning, growth, and application of statistical modeling techniques throughout the semester. It includes reflections on core course objectives, hands-on modeling work using R and the `tidymodels` framework, and a self-evaluation of my progress and challenges.

As a graduate student in data science, I am passionate about using data to uncover insights and make informed decisions. This course helped me build a solid foundation in regression modeling, including linear, logistic, multinomial, and regularized regression, along with essential concepts like model validation, inference, and interpretability.

I invite you to explore the portfolio and see how I applied these skills in real assignments and projects. Thank you for visiting!
